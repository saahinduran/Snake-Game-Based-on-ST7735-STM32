This repository contains core codes for a basic snake game. Although it still has bugs, it is playable for some configurations.
I did not want to deal with push buttons and hw at all, I made it playable from UART.
To play, press any button (8,6,2 or 4 from numpad) at the very beginning of the game. 
Play with numpad keys.


Screen porting is required.
SPI driver porting is required.
USB-TTL converter is required.
